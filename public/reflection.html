            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the journey of crafting my own portfolio website, I found myself immersed in a world of new knowledge
                and skills. I was introduced to the new programming languages of front-end, including HTML, CSS, and
                JavaScript, and with each line of code, allowed me to bring my vision to life.</p>
            <br />
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the process was not as smooth as I had initially anticipated. One of the biggest obstacles I
                faced was I did not know anything about the modern website developing process, as I do not know there
                are many existed frameworks that can help with the efficiency of website development. In retrospect, I
                realize that had I embraced the React framework earlier, I would have been able to organize my code more
                effectively, improve my development efficiency, and implement complex functions with greater ease.</p>
            <br />
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the most significant lessons I learned during this process was the importance of responsive
                design. One day I tried to show my website to my parents and found it cannot be correctly showed on
                mobile. I came to understand that a website is not confined to a single device or screen size, and that
                it must be able to adapt and look its best in any environment. </p>
            <br />
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, this realization was accompanied by a newfound appreciation for the role of small components in the
                overall design. I implemented my gallery by a React external module called “react-multi-carousel” so the
                entire developing process progressed in a very smooth and efficient manner. </p>
            <br />
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I look to the future, I am determined to make use of external resources to improve my development
                efficiency, create a clearer website structure, and achieve a better responsive design.</p>
            <br />
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, the process of creating my portfolio website was a journey of growth and discovery. It was a
                journey that tested my patience, challenged my abilities, and ultimately, taught me valuable lessons
                that I will carry with me as I continue to explore the world of programming.</p>
