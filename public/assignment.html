    <h1><b> My assignment.html page for linking to assignment items for your Website Assesment</b></h1>
    <p><br></p>
    <p>This page is the marking guide to your website that your tutor will use to find your elements.  Do not name this page anything other than assignment.html (all lower case) or else we may not be able to find and mark your assignment elements.<span>&nbsp; </span>How to use this page:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Please, link this page to your website's index.html page</li>
      <li>over time, link each assignment task listed below to its location in your website as soon as you have started it</li>
      <li>replace the "notes" paragraph with your notes or
    delete if you have no notes - your notes will help us understand and
    mark your site so you should explain things. Maybe you did a task
    differently from the way we specified it, either because your way is
    better (tell us) or minimally or not at all to fit in with your site's
    look and feel (tell us) or ... (also tell us). So, for example, a video
    might spoil the look and feel. What you do is make one anyway, link to
    it from this assessment.html page and explain in the <i>Notes</i> why
    it's not linked to from your public version of your web site. You can
    style this page as your like, so long as you keep the links to the
    assignment tasks.</li>
      <li>provide link to report where indicated</li>
      <li>delete these instructions when you are ready</li>
    </ul>
    <p><br></p>

    <h1><b>Website Release 2.0</b></h1>
    <h4><b>!Important: As the professor mentioned in the <a href="https://edstem.org/au/courses/15644/discussion/1830714">Clarifying use of libraries and frameworks in web assignments</a> on ED, we are allowed to use external libraries and frameworks as long as we follow the instructions. To make my webpage more closely resemble real-world development tasks and be more practical, I use React to build my website and it use JSX, a syntax extension of JavaScript that allows writing HTML-like tags within JavaScript. Since the compiled code is difficult to read, I uploaded the <a href="https://stuweb.cecs.anu.edu.au/~u7748799/src/">source code</a> on the StuWeb server and I will provide <a href="https://github.com/WhiteMasky/my-portfolio">Github</a> link in the following section for prettier code view. And I also did some static websites, then that can be easily graded, I will attach them at the same time.</b></h4>

    <p><b>Tech:</b> I used native HTML-like link to connect external social platforms and use Link and HashLink components from React Router library to complete other connections.</p>
    <p>Notes: I have created several CTAs on the website. The left-top compass icon links to the static website created in the first release, the character part centered vertically at the top link to different section of my website, and to the right of it there are also some social platform links(wait to be complete in next release). The footer section also has social media icons on the right, and on the left-bottom part there is a thumb up icon that can send me a like. All the icons are decorated with interactive effects so try hovering or clicking.</p>
