    <h1><b> My assignment.html page for linking to assignment items for your Website Assesment</b></h1>
    <p><br></p>
    <p>This page is the marking guide to your website that your tutor will use to find your elements.  Do not name this page anything other than assignment.html (all lower case) or else we may not be able to find and mark your assignment elements.<span>&nbsp; </span>How to use this page:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Please, link this page to your website's index.html page</li>
      <li>over time, link each assignment task listed below to its location in your website as soon as you have started it</li>
      <li>replace the "notes" paragraph with your notes or
    delete if you have no notes - your notes will help us understand and
    mark your site so you should explain things. Maybe you did a task
    differently from the way we specified it, either because your way is
    better (tell us) or minimally or not at all to fit in with your site's
    look and feel (tell us) or ... (also tell us). So, for example, a video
    might spoil the look and feel. What you do is make one anyway, link to
    it from this assessment.html page and explain in the <i>Notes</i> why
    it's not linked to from your public version of your web site. You can
    style this page as your like, so long as you keep the links to the
    assignment tasks.</li>
      <li>provide link to report where indicated</li>
      <li>delete these instructions when you are ready</li>
    </ul>
    <p><br></p>

    <h1><b>Website Release 2.0</b></h1>
    <h4><b>!Important: As the professor mentioned in the <a href="https://edstem.org/au/courses/15644/discussion/1830714">Clarifying use of libraries and frameworks in web assignments</a> on ED, we are allowed to use external libraries and frameworks as long as we follow the instructions. To make my webpage more closely resemble real-world development tasks and be more practical, I use React to build my website and it use JSX, a syntax extension of JavaScript that allows writing HTML-like tags within JavaScript. Since the compiled code is difficult to read, I uploaded the <a href="https://stuweb.cecs.anu.edu.au/~u7748799/src/">source code</a> on the StuWeb server and I will provide <a href="https://github.com/WhiteMasky/my-portfolio">Github</a> link in the following section for prettier code view. And I also did some static websites and apply JavaScript on it, then that can be easily graded, I will attach them at the same time.</b></h4>
    <h2><b>2.1 Call to Actions</b></h2>
    <a href="https://stuweb.cecs.anu.edu.au/~u7748799/index.html"><p>Yichi's Portfolio: <br />1 Click on the blue button before enter the main page; <br />2 Move to projects section and click on projects image button to link to source code.</p></a>  
    <a href="https://github.com/WhiteMasky/my-portfolio/blob/master/src/App.js">1 Source Code of the Enter page</a>  <br />
    <a href="https://github.com/WhiteMasky/my-portfolio/blob/master/src/components/Projects.js">2 Source Code of Projects.js</a><br />
    <a href="https://github.com/WhiteMasky/my-portfolio/blob/master/src/components/ProjectCard.js">2 Source Code of ProjectCard.js</a>
    <p><b>Tech:</b> I used useState in React to control the CTA before visitors enter my website, and use basic HTML link tag for the projects link.</p>
    <p>Notes: I have created 2 CTAs on the website. The primary one is the blue button which would jump into visitors' eyes before they see the substantial content of my website, this button aims at sparking people's interest in exploring my webpage. The secondary one is on the projects section, and has 3 subCTAs, if we put our mouse hovering on the project, there will be a curtain sliding down, on it there are a small title and a brief paragraph introducing my project, clicking the project will redirect to my GitHub project repository.</p>
    <h2><b>2.2 Photo Gallery</b></h2>
    <p><b>Tech:</b> I used a external npm package "react-multi-carousel" and it provided with a production-ready, lightweight fully customizable React carousel component. By changing the specific props, I made the following changes to the carousel: Responsive layout, infinite looping, swipeable and draggable behavior, center mode, automatic playback, and adjustable playback speed, etc.</p>
    <p>Notes: According to the ED post below, I use a photogallery template to show my life photos. (1) alter it to suit your <a href="https://stuweb.cecs.anu.edu.au/~u7748799/index.html">website (Please click Gallery on the navigation bar)</a> and (2)  log it in your <a href="https://stuweb.cecs.anu.edu.au/~u7748799/sourcelog.html">source log</a> (3) <a href="https://github.com/WhiteMasky/my-portfolio/blob/master/src/components/Gallery.js">comment</a> it thoroughly.</p>
    <h2><b>2.3 Javascript addition</b></h2>
    <p><b>first JavaScript</b></p>
    <p><b>Tech:</b>To facilitate easier SourceLog management, I have designed adding and deleting buttons for my SourceLog using native JavaScript. This allows me to conveniently perform addition and deletion operations (although in practice, the application would still need to connect to a backend database for storage).</p>
    <p>Notes: You can experience <a href="https://stuweb.cecs.anu.edu.au/~u7748799/sourcelog.html">Source Log Easy Adding & Deleting</a> here. </p>
    <p><b>second JavaScript</b></p>
    <p><b>Tech:</b>To make the feedback-form more interactive, the feedback form has been refactored into a questionnaire format using JavaScript. The subsequent questions will appear after the completion of the preceding questions. If no content is filled, a warning will pop up, and you won't be able to proceed to the next question. When you reach the last question, the button will change from "Next" to "Submit", and then you can send your feedback.</p>
    <p>Notes: You can experience <a href="https://stuweb.cecs.anu.edu.au/~u7748799/feedback.html">Feedback form in interactive questionnaire format</a> here. </p>
    <h2><b>2.4 Well written Javascript</b></h2>
    <p><b>first JavaScript</b></p>
    <p><b>Tech:</b> I applied different functions, showInputDialog() prompts the user to input data for each column of a new row. If any field is left empty, it alerts the user and prevents adding the row. addRow() adds a new row to the table with the provided data. deleteRow() removes the row containing the clicked delete button from the table. Together, these functions enable the dynamic addition and deletion of rows in the Source Log table based on user input and interaction.</p>
    <p>Notes: The main <a href="https://github.com/WhiteMasky/my-portfolio/blob/master/public/scripts/sourcelog.js">Script source code</a> can be viewed here. The simple add and delete buttons used <a href="https://github.com/WhiteMasky/my-portfolio/blob/master/public/sourcelog.html#L25-L231">inline JavaScript onclick event</a>.</p>
    <p><b>second JavaScript</b></p>
    <p><b>Tech:</b> Here, I've utilized a different JavaScript syntax, neither linking to an external script nor using inline scripting that I used before in the first JavaScript. The script sets up variables for the form, question container, next button, and submit button, initializing the current question index to 0. It manages an array called questions, representing each form question as objects with properties like label, input ID, input name, and type. The showCurrentQuestion() function dynamically updates the question container based on the current question index, generating HTML for different input types such as text and textarea. An event listener for the next button checks for empty input fields, increments the question index, and displays the next question. If it's the last question, a thank you message appears along with the submit button. Another event listener handles form submission, collecting data, constructing an email body, generating a mailto link, and opening it in the default email client.</p>
    <p>Notes: You can check the <a href="https://github.com/WhiteMasky/my-portfolio/blob/master/public/feedback.html#L26-L157">Script source code</a> in the script tag of HTML file. </p>
    
    <p>Additonal Notes: My website is built using React, so its primary language is JavaScript-based. However, it utilizes many framework-specific syntaxes. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/WhiteMasky/my-portfolio/tree/master/src/components">source code of various components</a> if interested.</p>

    <h1><b>Website Release 3.0</b></h1>
    <h2><b>3.1 Reflections</b></h2>
    <p><a href="https://stuweb.cecs.anu.edu.au/~u7748799/reflection.html">Reflections</a></p>
    <p>Notes: The reflection for grading is in the page linked above. Here I just want to thank the course, which gives me chance to learn one of the most practical skills for computing students. Also many thanks to lecturers and my tutors for answering my silly questions with patience. </p>
    <h2><b>3.2 Alternative CSS</b></h2>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/WhiteMasky/my-portfolio/blob/master/public/styles/dark.css">The Dark Mode CSS on GitHub for prettier preview</a><br />
      <a href="https://stuweb.cecs.anu.edu.au/~u7748799/styles/dark.css">Source code also on StuWeb</a>
    </p>
    <p>Notes: I developed a dark mode for my website. By clicking the Dark button in the navigation bar, the website will go from a light color to a dark color, which accomplished by changing the referenced CSS file.</p>
    <h2><b>3.3 Social Networking Button(s) or Feed(s)</b></h2>
    <p><a href="https://stuweb.cecs.anu.edu.au/~u7748799/">Please check the navigation bar and the footer of the website.</a></p>
    <p>Notes: Since my website is a self portfolio, it is appropriate that I linked social platform such as Linkedin, Github, Youtube, and Facebook on my website based on the web theme. The buttons are on the navigation bar as well as the footer section. Click and have a look if wanted. </p>
    <h2><b>3.4 Website Accesibility</b></h2>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/WhiteMasky/my-portfolio/tree/master/src">src folder on GitHub for prettier preview</a></p>
    <a href="https://stuweb.cecs.anu.edu.au/~u7748799/src">Also source file on StuWeb</a>
    <p>Notes: I have modified the code to meet the given requirements as follows:<br />
      •	All media has a descriptive alternative text.<br />
      •	Proper Headings structure is used.<br />
      •	All icon sizes are at least 45 x 45 pixels.<br />
      •	All site elements are accessible using the tab key on your keyboard. <br />
      •	All href links have an aria-label associated with them.<br />
      •	Abbreviations in content have an abbr tag associated with them.<br />
      </p>
    <h2><b>3.5 Website Validation</b></h2>
    <p><a href="https://stuweb.cecs.anu.edu.au/~u7748799/validation.html">W3C Validation Check</a></p>
    <p>Notes: The screenshot of validation is provided on the landing page. All the validation error has been corrected.</p>
    <h2><b>3.6 Something Original</b></h2>
    <p><a href="https://stuweb.cecs.anu.edu.au/~u7748799/">Please check the left-hand side pinned bar after entering the website.</a></p>
    <p>Notes: I use React framework in the website assignment and I do think this is meaningful action (however, since I start doing it during the second release so I am not pretty sure if it counts). Furthermore, this time I added a sidebar containing social platform share feature that can do a quick share(if the visitors like my website) of my website to 4 provided social platforms and it is pinned on the left side of my website. It will create a share post automatically on a specific social platform if you have your account saved. Otherwise, it will ask you to login first.</p>
